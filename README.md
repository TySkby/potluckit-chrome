## Potluck It
### An (unofficial) extension for Chrome browser


**What have we here?**

If you have a [Potluck It](http://potluck.it) account and want to be able
to quickly share a page to your account, but (like me) prefer to keep Chrome's
bookmarks toolbar hidden, you may (like me) find the Potluck It "button" (bookmarklet)
to be a bit suboptimal.

This is my attempt to rectify the situation by packaging the bookmarklet
into a Chrome extension!

If you've ever used [Pocket](http://getpocket.com), you might already know
how nifty it is to have an extension button at-the-ready for quickly adding
the page in your current tab to your Pocket list.

This is a pretty-darn-simple unpackaged Chrome extension.  It isn't available
from the Chrome Web Store, so if you want to install it, you'll need to enable
the "Developer Mode" checkbox in your [Chrome Extensions](chrome://extensions/)
settings.  You can either package the extension yourself, load the unpackaged
extension from source, or install the included *extension.crx* by dragging
the file into your Chrome browser.
